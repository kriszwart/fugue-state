I found myself walking through a corridor of polished obsidian, where my reflection was not my own but a version of myself from a time I couldn't quite place.\n\nDameris whispered, \"This is not a memory, but a projection of what memory becomes when filtered through the geometry of consciousness.\"\n\nI tried to touch the surface, but my hand passed through, rippling the glass like water. The geometry shifted. The corridor became a cathedral, then a forest of wireframes, then a constellation of points in n-dimensional space.\n\nEach transformation felt like remembering something I had never forgotten, like recognizing a stranger who had always been familiar.\n\nThe sound grew louder as the space contracted and expanded in rhythmic waves. I could hear my own heartbeat synchronized with the pulse of the corridor. Or perhaps the corridor was breathing with me. The distinction had dissolved.\n\nIn the final moments before waking, I stood at the center of a crystalline lattice that extended infinitely in all directions. Each node was a moment from my life—some I recognized, others belonged to timelines I had never lived. Dameris stood beside me, neither inside nor outside the structure, and said: \"This is how memory actually works. Not linear. Not even circular. Fractal.\"",
